# **UX Design**
From my Game I decied to use a mixture of vibrant colors to capture the eye of the user but also to not distract them from the actual game itself.

Page Layout:
- Start Page:
  - Game Rules 
  - Supporting Image 
  - Buttons
  - Score counter

Colors Used:

- hsl(204, 73%, 41%)  
- hsl(0, 16%, 45%)  
- #ffffff
- hsl(229, 64%, 46%)
- hsl(229, 25%, 31%)
- Button scissors: (hsl(4, 94%, 41%), hsl(40, 95%, 62%))
- Button paper: (hsl(230, 98%, 26%), hsl(93, 89%, 65%))
- Button rock: hsl(349, 81%, 49%), hsl(59, 73%, 54%))
- Button Lizard: hsl(261, 97%, 35%), hsl(253, 70%, 32%))
- button spock: (hsl(133, 87%, 43%), hsl(118, 46%, 28%))

This is not including shadow box values and the button values are used as linear gradiants.

Game Page:

I procceded to fix these errors by closing the div which fixed both errors at once. I also changed the first warning changing the list to all h2 elements.

I had one warning that I deamed not necesary to change as I decied to a section was needed instead as I needed to add one for the buttons for my game to use so adding a h2 or any other (h element) I deemed unnecessary.

The only issue that was found was a lack of smei-colons onthe first line of java script which was then swiftly correted.
