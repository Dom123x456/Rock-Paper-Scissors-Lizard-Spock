# **UX Design**
From my Game I decied to use a mixture of vibrant colors to capture the eye of the user but also to not distract them from the actual game itself.

Page Layout:
- Start Page:
  - Game Rules 
  - Supporting Image 
  - Buttons
  - Score counter

Colors Used:

- hsl(204, 73%, 41%)  
- hsl(0, 16%, 45%)  
- #ffffff
- hsl(229, 64%, 46%)
- hsl(229, 25%, 31%)
- Button scissors: (hsl(4, 94%, 41%), hsl(40, 95%, 62%))
- Button paper: (hsl(230, 98%, 26%), hsl(93, 89%, 65%))
- Button rock: hsl(349, 81%, 49%), hsl(59, 73%, 54%))
- Button Lizard: hsl(261, 97%, 35%), hsl(253, 70%, 32%))
- button spock: (hsl(133, 87%, 43%), hsl(118, 46%, 28%))

This is not including shadow box values and the button values are used as linear gradiants.
